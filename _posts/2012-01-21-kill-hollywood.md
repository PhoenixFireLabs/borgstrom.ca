I’ve been saying it for years. Hollywood is dying. It’s a bunch of old men & women who are far too stuck in their ways to grasp the slightest bit of what’s happened to the world around them and instead of trying to embrace it they decided to fight it by [suing the pants off of the consumers they’re trying to retain](http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/04/6662.ars).

Their latest attempt at holding onto their dying monopoly was the SOPA bill that has, for at least the time being, been shelved — but it serves to illuminate the levels at which they will try to use their influence to hold on for dear life.

[y-combinator says it the best way I’ve heard in a long time](http://ycombinator.com/rfs9.html):

> The people who run [Hollywood] are so mean and so politically connected that they could do a lot of damage to civil liberties and the world economy on the way down. It would therefore be a good thing if competitors hastened their demise.

They also go on to challenge us to come up with the best, most disruptive idea we can to hasten their demise.

"So, what is the most entertaining thing you can build?"
