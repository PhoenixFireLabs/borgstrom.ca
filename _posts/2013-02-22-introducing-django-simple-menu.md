Yesterday I released the first public version of [django-simple-menu](https://github.com/fatbox/django-simple-menu), which allows you to define your applications menu/navigation through the use of two simple objects.

The app was built as part of an internal project after we failed to find an existing menu system that was straight forward, didn't use the database for anything and allowed for complex menu items that were able to be influenced by the current request. It has been refined over the past three years and has now been split out into its own project as I need to re-use it in another site build.
