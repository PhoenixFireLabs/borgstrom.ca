<p>Last year I tried to upgrade from Snow Leopard (10.6) to Lion (10.7), and I HATED it. <a href="http://evan.borgstrom.ca/post/12436437644/downgrading-back-to-snow-leopard">So much so that I wrote a scathing blog post about</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>A few weeks ago after hearing that Mountain Lion (10.8) would be the last version to support directly upgrading from Snow Leopard (10.6) I decided to take the plunge and give Mountain Lion a try. If worse came to worse at least I'd be able to downgrade back to Snow Leopard again...</p>&#13;
<p>I have to say, so far I'm actually quite liking Mountain Lion. I had to go and get <a href="http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/">Total Spaces</a>Â to get the control over my virtual desktops that I want, but other than that my experience with 10.8 has been really good so far.</p>&#13;
<p>Today, however, I noticed that my RSS feeds that normally show up in Mail.app weren't there. "Strange" I thought, maybe they needed to be re-added after the upgrade. But to my dismay I found out that Apple has indeed discontinued RSS support in Mountain Lion...</p>&#13;
<p>At least they were nice enough to leave them in the <code>Info.plist</code> file so that you can <a href="http://www.macgasm.net/2012/07/30/tip-find-your-deleted-rss-feeds-in-mountain-lions-mail-app/">get them back through a little terminal magic</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>I guess I can live with having to run Google Reader in a <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid Site Specific Browser</a> (just 'cause Google Reader is awesome), but I sure am going to miss my daily photo blogs showing up inline with my mail every day.</p>
