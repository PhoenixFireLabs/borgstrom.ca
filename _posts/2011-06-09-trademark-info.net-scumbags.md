Dear scum bags at Trademark-Info.net,

Are you serious. Really? REALLY?

Did you really just send me an "invoice" for $1000 to be listed on your unofficial website directory of trademark listings and expect me to pay it?

I guess you're hoping that no one really looks into who you are and that big companies just assume that your invoice is something that should be paid so they send it down to AP.

Apparently I'm [not the](http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/UnsolicitedOffersUS.aspx) [only one](http://www.thelogofactory.com/logo_blog/index.php/trademark-infonet/) that isn't going to fall for your totally lowlife attempt at business.

By the way at the time of this post your website is EVEN down.
