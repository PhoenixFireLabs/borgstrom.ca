Does anyone else who lives in downtown Toronto have this odd feeling of regret? Regret for not really being aware of what was going on in [the 1998 amalgamation of our city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgamation_of_Toronto#1998_amalgamation)?

Let me make it a little more clear.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and the 2010 election results pretty much sum it.

Different cities, different agendas. While the people in the outer lying areas around downtown Toronto don't feel stuck with us, I sure feel stuck with them...

Clearly we don't have the same values. Don't get me wrong here, I've got lots of love for lots of people that live out there, but I definitely don't gel with general population there (it makes me feel creepy...)

My vote is for a de-amalgamation and return to the way things were from '68 to '97. Let's put running "Toronto" (proper.) back in the hands of those that live in Toronto and let our neighbors do their own thing. East York you're with us but Etobicoke, York, North York & Scarborough I think it's time we go our separate ways. 

Now, to figure out how to make this happen... Anyone know the process for de-amalgamation?
